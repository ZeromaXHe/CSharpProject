| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| C++           | Compiled with `clang 11 `using the latest C++ 17 standard.   | Your code is compiled with level two optimization (`-O2`). [AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) is also enabled to help detect out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.Most standard library headers are already included automatically for your convenience. |
| Java          | java 13.0.1                                                  | `OpenJDK 17 `. Java 8 features such as lambda expressions and stream API can be used.Most standard library headers are already included automatically for your convenience.Includes `Pair` class from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/util/Pair.html. |
| Python        | python 2.7.12                                                | Most libraries are already imported automatically for your convenience, such as [array](https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html), [bisect](https://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html), [collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html). If you need more libraries, you can import it yourself.For Map/TreeMap data structure, you may use [sortedcontainers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/) library.Note that Python 2.7 [will not be maintained past 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/). For the latest Python, please choose Python3 instead. |

[AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) is also enabled to help detect out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.Most standard library headers are already included automatically for your convenience.For hash table operations, you may use [uthash](https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/). "uthash.h" is included by default. Below are some examples:**1. Adding an item to a hash.**`struct hash_entry {    int id;            /* we'll use this field as the key */    char name[10];    UT_hash_handle hh; /* makes this structure hashable */ }; struct hash_entry *users = NULL; void add_user(struct hash_entry *s) {    HASH_ADD_INT(users, id, s); } ` **2. Looking up an item in a hash:**`struct hash_entry *find_user(int user_id) {    struct hash_entry *s;    HASH_FIND_INT(users, &user_id, s);    return s; } ` **3. Deleting an item in a hash:**`void delete_user(struct hash_entry *user) {    HASH_DEL(users, user);   }` |
